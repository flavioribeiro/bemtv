<h2>Hybrid CDN/P2P Architecture for HLS</h2>
</div>

## Introduction

BemTV is an open-source P2P library for the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol. Originally developed by Flavio Ribeiro, Streamroot acquired the project in early 2016.

Like Streamroot, BemTV makes use of the WebRTC protocol to decentralise delivery and decrease the number of requests to CDN servers, reducing the cost of transmission and enhancing systemâ€™s scalability. It is an attempt to scale live video streaming using peer-to-peer without the need for an external plug-in.
